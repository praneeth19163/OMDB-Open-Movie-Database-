# OMDB-Open-Movie-Database-
Built a third party api integration OMDB to compare synchronous and asynchronous execution.

The synchronous.py and asynchronous.py is allowed to take a movie title and check whether it is present in movies or movies1 databases respectively if it present it will fetch form the database or else it will keep a request for OMDB api.

app.py is used to compare synchronous and asynchronous.
